# knights-travails
A JS script to find the shortest path on a chessboard for a knight, given initial placement and desired endpoint.

The original assignement used printed console.log calls to output the results.
I decided to add a webpage that shows the result along with a chessboard GUI to select
the next move and to view the shortest moves for the calculated path.
